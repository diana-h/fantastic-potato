<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction">&#182;</a></h2><p>For those looking to buy a rental property, deciding where to buy is a major concern.</p>
<p>"Best neighborhood" to rent out a property can be quite subjective and defined in multiple ways. I would like to define it here as a 'hot' neighborhood with lots of growth in rental prices in this past year. In other words, among similar level neighborhoods, the best neighborhood of that cluster would be the one with highest year-on-year growth in rental prices.</p>
<p>A general approach:<br>
Neighborhoods can be clustered into similar types of neighborhoods by certain features such as subway accessibility, number of grocery stores, and number of restaurants. In a given cluster of neighborhoods, a comparison of the neighborhood's median rental price and the year-on-year change in price can be made. Thus, each cluster's neighborhood with the highest rental price and also the neighborhood with the most growth in rental prices can be identified.</p>

<p><strong>Neighborhood features to cluster on:</strong><br>
1) Subway accessibility: Number of entrances/exits for the subway in each neighborhood as geodata points<br>

<p>2) Number of Grocery Store, Market, Organic grocery, Bakery, Butcher, Supermarket, Drugstore, Pharmacy in each neighborhood<br>

I expected that subway accessibility, number of nearby grocery stores/supermarkets, and number of restaurants in the neighborhood would be important characteristics that one would use to choose a neighborhood in NYC to live in.<br>
Since I was only interested in Manhattan and Brooklyn boroughs, I narrowed down my datasets to just contain these two boroughs.</p>

<h2 id="Discussion">Discussion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Discussion">&#182;</a></h2><p>Using the features of number of grocery stores, subway exits, and restaurants in each neighborhood, the neighborhoods cluster into four groups. The characteristics of each clusters are show in the results section. Interestingly, most neighborhoods have  low-medium levels of grocery stores and very low to low accessibility by subway. Restaurant density is generally quite high.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of neighborhood one would like to buy in, different neighborhoods stand out as good bets.</p>
<p>In cluster type 0 with high levels of grocery stores and restaurants with low subway access, the median rental price is generally lower than the other clusters, signifying that these were relatively cheaper places to live. Among these neighborhoods, Chinatown is likely overpriced for rent, while Kensington had good rental price growth this past year.</p>
<p>Cluster type 1 neighborhoods have low-medium levels of groceries and restaurants and very low subway accessibility. Compared to the other clusters, it appears as if these neighborhoods had the least amount of each of the features I identified. Gowanus has surprising amounts of growth in rental price and is likely a gentrifying neighborhood.</p>
<p>Cluster type 2 neighborhoods are characterized by high subway accessibility and med-high number of restaurants. Among these neighborhoods, Williamsburg has strong growth in rental price compared to neighborhoods of the same median rental price.</p>
<p>Cluster type 3 neighborhoods have a high number of restaurants and low subway accessibility. Most neighborhoods fall into this cluster. Little italy (Nolita), Greenwich Village, and Carroll Gardens all have strong rental price growth compared to similarly priced neighborhoods.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion">&#182;</a></h2><p>In conclusion, looking at just the number of grocery stores, subway entrances/exits, and restaurants, Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhoods can be clustered into four types of neighborhoods. From each of these types of neighborhoods, we can identify a few neighborhoods that have much higher rental price growth compared to its similar neighborhoods with similar median rental price. These neighborhoods are likely good places to invest in for a rental property.</p>
