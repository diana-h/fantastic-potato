    "#### The problem: What is the best neighborhood to own a rental property in New York City?  \n",
    "\n",
    "For those looking to buy a rental property, deciding where to buy is a major concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Best neighborhood\" to rent out a property can be quite subjective and defined in multiple ways. I would like to define it here as a 'hot' neighborhood with lots of growth in rental prices in this past year. In other words, among similar level neighborhoods, the best neighborhood of that cluster would be the one with highest year-on-year growth in rental prices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A general approach:  \n",
    "Neighborhoods can be clustered into similar types of neighborhoods by certain features such as subway accessibility, number of grocery stores, and number of restaurants. In a given cluster of neighborhoods, a comparison of the neighborhood's median rental price and the year-on-year change in price can be made. Thus, each cluster's neighborhood with the highest rental price and also the neighborhood with the most growth in rental prices can be identified.  \n",
